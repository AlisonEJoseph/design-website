## Good design requires a deep understanding of the business domain being designed for.
<p size="md">Rather than siloing designers into a single organization, we distribute them throughout teams and business units across IBM.<br><br>Embedding designers directly into the business allows them to build a rigorous understanding of the domain they’re working in. This knowledge, in turn, helps them align and collaborate more effectively with developers, engineers, offering managers, and all of the other disciplines that must come together to deliver a great outcome.</p>

## When users are intimately involved in the design process, you’re all but guaranteed to create something they love. 
<p size="md">User-centered design goes far beyond just speaking with a few people before you get started; it’s about truly co-creating with your business users and stakeholders by making them integral members of the team.<br><br>From the initial visioning stages through to delivery and beyond, we work closely with both of these groups to ensure that every decision we make is rooted in a deep understanding of their needs.</p>
